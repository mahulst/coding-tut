Repo for a coding tutorial for HR department.

We are building a simple calculator with which we can add two numbers.

Assignment 1: Getting stuff up and running

Start with opening your terminal. (command+space and type "terminal" on Mac)

First we need to download the source, to do so type the following command in your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/mahulst/coding-tut

To navigate to the folder that was just created, type in your terminal:
cd coding-tut

Open a file browser and navigate to the folder (in your home folder there is now a new folder called 'coding-tut'

Now double click the "index.html" file which should open your browser

Try to put numbers in input 1 and input 2 and click the add button!


Assignment 2:

Now you will try to add functionality to the calculator

Open your terminal and enter the following command:
git checkout step-2
